Code for variability-based inversion of Hg surface fluxes

This repository includes all code required to reproduce analysis and figures from Roy et al. (2026) - Variability-based constraints on regional gaseous elemental mercury fluxes. Some measurement data and model inputs must be downloaded to execute scripts. Full description of code structure and accompanying data is available on Zenodo ().
